# Minimum Cost to Split into Ones

Can you solve this real interview question? Minimum Cost to Split into Ones - You are given an integer n.

In one operation, you may split an integer x into two positive integers a and b such that a + b = x.

The cost of this operation is a * b.

Return an integer denoting the minimum total cost required to split the integer n into n ones.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 3

Output: 3

Explanation:

One optimal set of operations is:

x a b a + b a * b Cost 3 1 2 3 2 2 2 1 1 2 1 1

Thus, the minimum total cost is 2 + 1 = 3.

Example 2:

Input: n = 4

Output: 6

Explanation:

One optimal set of operations is:

x a b a + b a * b Cost 4 2 2 4 4 4 2 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 1

Thus, the minimum total cost is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.
