Definition says "been cited at least h times " 
 so, 4 papers, at index 3, has been cited at least 1 times
4 papers can't be cited  at least 4 times or at least 3 times or any number > the minimum citation we see at this index, viz  1

_Hence, we have to take min(citation[i], index+1) for h-idx_
(0-index) h-idx = min(4, 1)

We don;t stop here, idea is to MAXIMIZE  h-Index and we have to Try every Index in this fashion Uptil Maximum Allowed index

Basically we have the maximize the last column in table above^^
