# Smallest Pair With Different Frequencies

Can you solve this real interview question? Smallest Pair With Different Frequencies - You are given an integer array nums.

Consider all pairs of distinct values x and y from nums such that:

 * x < y
 * x and y have different frequencies in nums.

Among all such pairs:

 * Choose the pair with the smallest possible value of x.
 * If multiple pairs have the same x, choose the one with the smallest possible value of y.

Return an integer array [x, y]. If no valid pair exists, return [-1, -1].

The frequency of a value x is the number of times it occurs in the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,2,2,3,4]

Output: [1,3]

Explanation:

The smallest value is 1 with a frequency of 2, and the smallest value greater than 1 that has a different frequency from 1 is 3 with a frequency of 1. Thus, the answer is [1, 3].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,5]

Output: [-1,-1]

Explanation:

Both values have the same frequency, so no valid pair exists. Return [-1, -1].

Example 3:

Input: nums = [7]

Output: [-1,-1]

Explanation:

There is only one value in the array, so no valid pair exists. Return [-1, -1].
